# Practicing Test Driven Development
This repository contains a simple To-Do list web application made with Django while working through
<cite>Test Driven Development with Python</cite> by Harry J.W. Percival. The code is based on the
code from the book, as is permitted, but I have endeavoured to modify and enhance the application
as applicable in order to apply the learned concepts.

The largest changes come from using upgraded versions of Django and Bootstrap.
    
* Django has been updated from version 3 to version 4.
    * Changes to how urls are bound.
* Bootstrap updated from version 3 to version 5.
    * Classes have been altered.
    * "jumbotron" is now deprecated and is replaced with Utilities.
